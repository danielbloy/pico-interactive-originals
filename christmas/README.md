# Christmas 2023 Code Club Project

Materials:
* 1 x Baker Ross wooden scene (Sanatas Workshop or Penguin House)
* 1 x Pi Pico H running CircuitPython
* 1 x Circuit containing:
  * 1 x Battery (3V coins if possible)
  * 1 x Ring of 8 NeoPixels (GP28) 
  * 1 x Button (GP27)
  * 1 x Piezo Buzzer (GP0 or GP1)
  * 4 x LEDs (GP2, GP3, GP4, GP5) Red, Green, Blue, Yellow

### Wooden scene
The Children can pick this themselves though they will be ready made, all are large 
enough to take the board and Pico. The children can colour these with Sharpies or 
felt-tip pens.

### Circuit board
This needs to be small and contain enough "devices" to allow for interest in coding.
At a minimum it will contain a connector for the NeoPixel ring, a buzzer and a connector 
to attach an AA battery box.

### Coding
There are a range of abilities:
* No Python experience (3)
* Some Python experience (2)
* Reasonable Python experience (1)

**Button**
Simple push button that can be used to control sound or lights/

**Audio**
This will be done through my own music library and provide the usual example songs.

**NeoPixels**
This will use the Adafruit CircuitPython support for NeoPixels as it has many cool effects.

**LEDs**
This will be done through my own LED library.
